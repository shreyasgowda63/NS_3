/**
 * This example shows how to use the LrWpanGlobalRouting(Device|Helper).
 * The scenario consists of a grid with 20 nodes (2x10) which are placed with 100m distance between "adjacent" nodes.
 * We want to send a packet from node 0 to 19 (one corner of the grid to the opposite one).
 * The multi-hop routing functionality needed for this is provided by the LrWpanGlobalRoutingDevices installed on the LrWpanNetDevices.
 * 
 * The routes for this could either be set up manually (LrWpanStaticRoutingDevice) or automatically, as we do it here.
 * The LrWpanGlobalRoutingHelper instance will tell each LrWpanGlobalRoutingDevice when to send what kind of packet (neighbor discovery)
 * and it will collect the resulting data.
 * After a set amount of time, it will calculate routes for all devices using breadth-first search.
 * The resulting routes are then automatically installed on the devices and the network is operational.
 * 
 * After this, we will send the packet from node 0 to 19 and print a message whenever a LrWpanNetDevice (which is used by our routing devices)
 * receives a packet.
 * This is to show the path taken by the packet.
