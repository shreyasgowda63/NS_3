 * 
 * \brief Device Energy Model for a sensor device.
 * 
 * This DeviceEnergyModel models the energy consumption by a sensor device.
 * For this, four states are defined: Measure, Idle, Sleep, and Off.
 * 
 * Unlike other DeviceEnergyModels like the WifiRadioEnergyModel,
 * changing between states at the right moment is the user's responsibility.
 * 
 * The methods SensorDeviceEnergyModel::ScheduleMeasure and SensorDeviceEnergyModel::MeasureNow
 * can be used to set up "measurement activities" for this model.
 * Those activities will be assigned an SensorDeviceEnergyModel::Id which can be used by the user to figure out whether 
 * the activity was successful.
 * Activities can fail when there is not enough energy or they are canceled by the user (by changing the state manually).
 * 
 * Changes into/between other states (i.e., SensorDeviceEnergyModel::SensorModelState::Idle,
 * SensorDeviceEnergyModel::SensorModelState::Sleep, SensorDeviceEnergyModel::SensorModelState::Off (manually))
 * have to be done directly using the SensorDeviceEnergyModel::ChangeState method.
