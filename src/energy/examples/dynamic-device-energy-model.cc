/**
 * This example shows how to create and use the DynamicDeviceEnergyModel.
 * The scenario consists of two nodes with LrWpanNetDevices that send packets between each other.
 * Whenever one node receives a packet (ProtocolHandler method), it's DynamicDeviceEnergyModel
 * will change between different states for 1000ms and then send the same packet back to the other node.
 * This will stop after 10 seconds.
 * 
 * The concrete state changes are (with time being relative to the point when the packet was received):
 * - 0ms: Work state
 * - 500ms: Peak state
 * - 550ms: Work state
 * - 1000ms: Idle state
 * 
 * Both energy models start in the Idle state.
 * The currents for each state are:
 * - Off: 0A (implicit state, is always present and has index 0)
 * - Idle: 3mA
 * - Work: 50mA
 * - Peak: 100mA
