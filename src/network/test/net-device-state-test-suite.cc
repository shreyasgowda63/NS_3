// This test suite demonstrates and checks the basic operation of the

// to any NetDevice type.  Any number of objects can listen for state
// changes.  Usually, the NetDevice or associated Channel will cause
// state transitions (and will call the public methods of NetDeviceState
// to change its state), but this basic test just hooks two listeners
// to the state change trace source, and uses the public API to invoke
// state changes that are checked in the listening methods.
