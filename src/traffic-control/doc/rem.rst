REM queue disc
----------------

This chapter describes the REM ([Athuraliya]_) queue disc implementation 
in |ns3|. 

Random Exponential Marking (REM) is a queuing discipline that aims to achieve
high utilization, negligible loss and delay in a simple and scalable manner.
The code was ported to |ns3| by Isha Tarte, Aparna R. Joshi, Navya R. S., and
Mohit P. Tahiliani based on ns-2 code implemented by Sanjeewa Athuraliya
([Rem17]). The ns-3 implementation was updated to work with ns-3.35 by Kushagra
Gupta.


Model Description
*****************

The source code for the REM model is located in the directory
``src/traffic-control/model`` and consists of 2 files `rem-queue-disc.h` and
`rem-queue-disc.cc` defining a RemQueueDisc class. The code was ported to |ns3|
by Aparna R. Joshi, Isha Tarte and Navya R. S. based on ns-2 code implemented
by Sanjeewa Athuraliya.

* class :cpp:class:`RemQueueDisc`: This class implements the main REM algorithm:

  * ``RemQueueDisc::DoEnqueue ()``: This routine checks whether the queue is
full, and if so, drops the packets and records the number of drops due to queue
overflow. If queue is not full, this routine calls ``RemQueueDisc::DropEarly()``,
and depending on the value returned, the incoming packet is either enqueued or
dropped.

  * ``RemQueueDisc::DropEarly ()``: The decision to enqueue or drop the packet
is taken by invoking this routine, which returns a boolean value; false
indicates enqueue and true indicates drop.

  * ``RemQueueDisc::RunUpdateRule ()``: This routine is called at a regular
interval of `m_updateInterval` and updates the drop probability, which is
required by ``RemQueueDisc::DropEarly()``

  * ``RemQueueDisc::DoDequeue ()``: This routine removes the packet from the
queue.

Attributes
==========

The key attributes that the RemQueueDisc class holds include the following: 

* ``MaxSize:`` The maximum number of bytes or packets the queue can hold.
* ``MeanPktSize:`` Mean packet size in bytes. The default value is 1000 bytes.
* ``UpdateInterval:`` Time period to calculate drop probability. The default value is 2 ms. 
* ``InputWeight:`` Weight assigned to input rate. The default value is 1.0. 
* ``Phi:`` Value of Phi used to calculate probability. The default value is 1.001. 
* ``Target:`` Target queue length. The default value is 20 packets.
* ``Alpha:`` Value of Alpha. The default value is 0.1.
* ``Gamma:`` Value of Beta. The default value is 0.001.
* ``LinkBandwidth:`` The REM link bandwidth. The default value is 1.5 Mbps.

Examples
========

The example for REM is `rem-example.cc` located in ``examples/traffic-control``.
To run the file (the first invocation below shows the available command-line options):

:: 

   $ ./waf --run "rem-example --PrintHelp"
   $ ./waf --run "rem-example --writePcap=1" 

The expected output from the previous commands are 10 .pcap files.

Validation
**********

The REM model is tested using :cpp:class:`RemQueueDiscTestSuite` class defined in
``src/traffic-control/test/rem-queue-test-suite.cc``. The suite includes 5 test cases:

* Test 1: simple enqueue/dequeue with defaults, no drops
* Test 2: more data with defaults, unforced drops but no forced drops
* Test 3: same as test 2, but with higher Target
* Test 4: Packets are ECN capable, but REM queue disc is not ECN enabled
* Test 5: Packets are ECN capable and REM queue disc is ECN enabled

The test suite can be run using the following commands: 

::

  $ ./waf configure --enable-examples --enable-tests
  $ ./waf build
  $ ./test.py -s rem-queue-disc

or  

::

  $ NS_LOG="RemQueueDisc" ./waf --run "test-runner --suite=rem-queue-disc"
