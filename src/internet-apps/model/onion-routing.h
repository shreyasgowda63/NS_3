 * \brief Abstract class for creation and decryption of Onion messagess.
 *
 * The OnionRouting abstract class include useful methods for the creation
 * and redirection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing">Onion Messagess</a>. 
 * The given class can be used to construct onion messagess of the following features:<br>
 *   ONION_NO_CONTENT - onion message including only routing information<br>
 *      example: (((10.1.1.2) 10.1.1.1) 10.1.1.5)10.1.1.3<br><br>
 * 
 *   ONION_ENDCONTENT - onion message including content to be delivered to the last node in the path<br>
 *      example: ((((end_content,0.0.0.0) 10.1.1.2) 10.1.1.1) 10.1.1.5) 10.1.1.3<br><br>
 * 
 *   ONION_LAYERCONTENT - onion message including a content of fixed length (in bytes) in each layer<br>
 *      example: ((((layer_content,0.0.0.0) layer_content,10.1.1.2) layer_content,10.1.1.1) layer_content,10.1.1.5)10.1.1.3<br><br>
 * 
 *   ONION_LAYERCONTENT_ENDCONTENT - onion message including a content of fixed length in each layer and 
 *                                   content of arbitrary length to be delivered to the last node in the path<br>
 *      example: ((((end_content,0.0.0.0) layer_content,10.1.1.2) layer_content,10.1.1.1) layer_content,10.1.1.5)10.1.1.3<br><br>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <br>The given class can be used to construct onion circuits as described in 
 * \e Hiding \e Routing \e Information by david M. Goldschlag, Micheal G. Reed, and Paul F. Syverson, May 1996<br>
 * 
 *
 * We designed an abstract class to allow the use of an arbitrary encryption suite, 
 * by implementing methods EncryptLayer & DecryptLayer
